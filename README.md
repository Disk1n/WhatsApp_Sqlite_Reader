## Installation & usage
1. pip install jupyter pandas
2. jupyter notebook 
3. surf to http://localhost:8888 (if it doesn't open automatically due to step 2) and choose the notebook from this repository

## Android
[The following project was suggested as a way to extract the DB from Android encryption](https://github.com/YuriCosta/WhatsApp-GD-Extractor-Multithread). I haven't looked at it myself but including it here in case you are looking for somehting like that. 

## Future work
I might add tools to analyze conversations and list them in a more user friendly way if I get bored
